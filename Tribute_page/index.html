            Ratan Naval Tata (born 28 December 1937) is an Indian industrialist,
            philanthropist, and a former chairman of Tata Sons. He was also
            chairman of Tata Group, from 1990 to 2012, and again, as interim
            chairman, from October 2016 through February 2017, and continues to
            head its charitable trusts.[3][4] He is the recipient of two of the
            highest civilian awards of India, the Padma Vibhushan (2008) and
            Padma Bhushan (2000).

            Born in 1937, he is a scion of the Tata family, and great-grandson
            of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of Tata Group. He is an alumnus of the
            Cornell University College of Architecture. He joined his company in
            1961, and was the apparent successor to J. R. D. Tata upon the
            latter's retirement in 1991. During Ratan Tata's chairmanship of 21
            years, revenues grew over 40 times, and profit, over 50 times.[8] He
            boldly got Tata Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar
            Land Rover, and Tata Steel to acquire Corus, in an attempt to turn
            Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business.
