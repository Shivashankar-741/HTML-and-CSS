              <h5>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h5>
              <p>
                Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables,
                or a beer fridge, and it doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big
                corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and
                the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what
                stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for
                designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that
                embraces design and allows it to succeed.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits
                of organizations that *get* design, both large and small. He
                will share what those teams, departments, and companies have
                that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change
                your own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a
                culture of design it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself
                anywhere else.
              </p>

                LIGHTS! CAMERA! INTERACTION! DESIGN INSPIRATION FROM FILMMAKERS
              </h5>
              <p>
                Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only
                with a combination of well-written narrative and effective
                storytelling technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to put this
                together. To do so they’ve developed processes, tools and
                techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize
                information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that
                together comprise a well-told story.
              </p>
              <p>
                With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in
                design and expand on the technical aspects used in film to
                communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in film, such as
                cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider
                why they’re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.

                Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate

                its success. Occasionally, he shares his perspectives on design

              <p>
                JavaScript applications frequently utilize battle-tested
                libraries like jQuery, AngularJS, Backbone.js and more, but how

                will share tips on how writing tests can be written easily and
                quickly and how to remove buggy code through testing.

              <p>
                Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process.
                Prototyping makes things a little better by allowing you to
                stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic
                interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                is even better and faster; it increases collaboration and
                improves the iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live
                rapid prototyping.
